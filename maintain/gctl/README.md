# Go-Recipes Control

Go-recipes Control (or gctl for short) is used to manage common tasks for this project. It's still a work in progress. Currently, only the `ls` subcommand is implemented, which displays all examples in this project.

```bash
gctl ls <relative path to project root directory>
```
