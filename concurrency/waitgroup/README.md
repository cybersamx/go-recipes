# WaitGroup

Go's `sync` package provides some primitives for synchronizing concurrency, including WaitGroup. This recipe shows how we use WaitGroup to synchronize across multiple concurrent goroutines.

## Setup

1. Run the program

   ```bash
   $ make run
   ```

## Reference

* [Godoc: WaitGroup](https://golang.org/pkg/sync/#WaitGroup)
