# Connecting to MongoDB

An example of how you would connect to MongoDB and perform basic CRUD operations.

## Requirements

* MongoDB version 4 and above.

## Setup

1. Launch a shell session and start MongoDB (server) via Docker:

   ```bash
   $ docker-compose up
   ```

1. You can connect to Mongo via the console:

   ```bash
   $ docker exec -it mongo mongo -u nobody -p secrets go-recipes
   ```

1. You can press CTRL-C and CTRL-D on the `mongo-server` and `mongo-cli` respectively to stop the containers. Don't forget to remove the containers as well.

   ```bash
   $ # This should remove both mongo-server and mongo-cli
   $ docker-compose down
   ```

1. Run Go programL

   ```bash
   $ go run ./main.go
   ```

1. Alternatively, you can run everything with the following command.

   ```bash
   $ make
   ```

## Notes

* We deliberately hard code the password to connect to MongoDB to keep the sample code simple and easy to understand. Do not do this in your code, especially production code.
